# Hardware folder

Use this folder to keep mechanical and PCB design files together.

## Subfolders
- `ringlight-24v-2x4-osram/` — **Put your 24 V ring light KiCad project here** (schematic, PCB, 3D, gerbers).
- `z-gantry-juki/` — Models/drawings for the JUKI-compatible Z gantry.

## Mechanical Parts & Printables
- `aluminum-bed` — 460×300 mm bed with 30 mm hole grid and 45 mm camera hole.
- [LumenPnP v4 printables](https://github.com/opulo-inc/lumenpnp) — used for most printed parts in this build.

> Reminder: **Don’t overwrite** your working OpenPnP `machine.xml` with the one in `configs/`. Use that file as **guidance** and copy only the bits you need.
